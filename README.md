# My First Project ğŸš€

Project to build a number guessing game in which the computer randomly selects a number and the user has to guess it. The user will have a limited number of chances to guess the number. If the user guesses the number correctly, the game ends and the user wins. If not, the game continues until the user runs out of chances.
